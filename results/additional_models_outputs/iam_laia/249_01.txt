First of all simple part-songs : I found ony one member who had
any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an
old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quie well
and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to
teach by singing the part with them . It was very amusing , and by
the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
