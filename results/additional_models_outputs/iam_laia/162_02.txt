HOW do you get on records ? well , you 've got
to have something different . Sing slightly flat .
All the good singers sing in tune. Twang a guitar
slightly off key. Everybody ''s fed up with the
right way - so the best-seller charts say . Play
an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one . Y o ot to
toget it into your head , son ... pleape
don't like things as they should be - not on
record , anyway .
