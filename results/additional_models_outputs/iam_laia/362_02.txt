This remarkable man of medicine , wha sir Froncis
Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
' more like a God upon earth than a huwan being ' ,
had an increasing number of disciples among
unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe . One
of these was the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mouro ,
whom Anglesey eonsulted in May 1834 .
