A great blo distrurbed all or efforts in the following
year , 1914 , when war broke out . Very soon Chaplains for
the forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly
that one of us must volunteer . The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did
not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the porish
for a year . Mr. Evitt , however , was much less committed
that his Vicar , and he was accepted at once and
was very soon in Franck where he did splendid
work until his health broke don and he had a bad
attack of enteric fever .
