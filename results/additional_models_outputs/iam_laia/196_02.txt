There may be some who will argue that
routine destroys the soul . It is so easy ,
they say , to get into a rut . Save ns
from the school curriculum an even
worse the school system whereby for
meals everybody khows beforehand
exactly what , on any given ay of the
week , they are going to have . If- such
a critice may say - you are calling
us to cventure , do not strangle us before
we start by putling us into a strait-jacket
