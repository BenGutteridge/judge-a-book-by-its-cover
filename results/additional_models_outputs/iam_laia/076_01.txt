The views of the Archbishop , who has
maintained an unflinching witness to what
Christianity really means , must cary weight . But
what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries
do to bring support and comfort to this gallant

policy of appeasement has modified the
actions of the Nationalist . On the contrary ,
apartheid is being applied ever more
ruthlessly .
