The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the
church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. C. U. Evitt in
lais soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission
distril and got to know , and be known by  many of
the people of the parish .
