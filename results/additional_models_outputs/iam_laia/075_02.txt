A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
tinue to live as hewer of wood and drawen of
water in the white aras of South Africa , without rights
and without hope . TE same sort of good neighbour
that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
Hitler in the thirties . It was Dr. Verwoerd who
led a protest against admitting any of them
because they would " defile " the national
white stock .
