The new century opened with James' I ascending
the throne . He was quite prepared to be
tolerant towards Rome though the Empower Plot
spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for
James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,
but those hopes were lashed . Trne , a new Prayer
Burk was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
derived little comfort from it .
