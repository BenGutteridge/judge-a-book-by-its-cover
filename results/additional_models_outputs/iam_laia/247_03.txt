Speaking of churchwardens and children lead s
me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
continuing till old age to-day . When I went
to St. Mark's , the firt contact I made was
with the Vicar''s Warden Mr. F. W. Charlton
and his family , the youngert of whose three
sons was just coming into the world in this year
of 1913 .
