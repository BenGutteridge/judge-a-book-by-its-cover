AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the electricity
Board . The board is laying a cable alag a seven-
mile route in Surrey . A warden , Mr. Jack Finlay
has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
householders when trenches are dug outside their
front gates . Splendide . By showing concern
for the people the board will earn their good will .
Happy patrolling , Mr. Finlay !
