have changed a good deal since that date the questions
for road material is steadily increasing : He still
are no longer solely the concern of the neighbour hood ,
and the National Trust has come into being and
has already earned a great reputation , here are
all new factors .
I suggest therefore that , without committing
themselves to despair , the Conservative rugby arrange
to meet representatives of the National Trust and
disenses proposals on the lines I have suggested .
I have no knowledge of the attitude of the N.T.
to these suggestions , but I feel sure they would be
quite ready to discuss them if invited to do so .
If the Conservators would like me to elaborate
my suggestions or to answer criticisms , I should
be only too happy to do so , & I have no objection
to this letter being made public . "
After discussions the following Resolution
was on the motion of the Vice Chairman ( THE LAYton )
recorded by Mr. W.S. Lane unanimously passed :
That the Malvern Hills Conservative will welcome
any help on suggestions from the National Trust
or any other authority in the raising of funds for
the purchase of any existing quasaying rights on the
Malvern Hills .
