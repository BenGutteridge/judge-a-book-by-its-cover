The handwritten line from a document page reads: "What is the difference between a document and a page? A document has a title and is usually numbered, while a page is a separate sheet of paper with a title at the top. A document may have multiple pages, while a page may be part of a larger document. The two terms are often used interchangeably, but it is important to understand the distinctions between them in order to properly organize and access information."
